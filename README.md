# MapApp

## Description

Project developed with Angular v14 and mapbox-gl.

It is a simple application in which we use the mapbox API to search for streets and calculate the distance between my location and the selected point.

In the route that is shown we can see the distance in Kilometers and the time to travel said distance in minutes.

To be able to authenticate or register you must use the backend developed in express called AuthServer,
